# This is part of my professional training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI), I dedicated myself fully to mastering Power BI, working with the tool intensively on a daily basis. This hands-on journey involved continuous practice, experimentation, and learning through trial and error. Throughout the program, I successfully delivered over 20 end-to-end Power BI projects, gaining deep expertise in data modeling, DAX, visualization best practices, and performance optimization. It was a transformative experience that equipped me with both technical proficiency and strategic insight into business intelligence solutions.
